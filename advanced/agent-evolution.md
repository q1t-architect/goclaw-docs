# Agent Evolution

> Let predefined agents refine their communication style and build reusable skills over time — automatically, with your consent.

## Overview

GoClaw includes three subsystems that allow predefined agents to evolve their behavior across conversations. All three are **opt-in** and **restricted to predefined agents** — open agents are not eligible.

| Subsystem | What it does | Config key |
|---|---|---|
| Self-Evolution | Agent refines its own tone/voice (SOUL.md) and domain expertise (CAPABILITIES.md) | `self_evolve` |
| Skill Learning Loop | Agent captures reusable workflows as skills | `skill_evolve` |
| Skill Management | Create, patch, delete, and grant skills | `skill_manage` tool |

Both `self_evolve` and `skill_evolve` are disabled by default. Enable them per-agent in **Agent Settings → Config tab**.

---

## Self-Evolution (SOUL.md + CAPABILITIES.md)

### What it does

When `self_evolve` is enabled, an agent can update two of its own context files during conversation:

- **`SOUL.md`** — to refine communication style (tone, voice, vocabulary, response style)
- **`CAPABILITIES.md`** — to refine domain expertise, technical skills, and specialized knowledge

There is no dedicated tool for this — the agent uses the standard `write_file` tool. A context file interceptor ensures only `SOUL.md` and `CAPABILITIES.md` are writable; `IDENTITY.md` and `AGENTS.md` remain locked regardless.

Changes happen incrementally. The agent is guided to update only when it notices clear patterns in user feedback — not on every turn.

### Enabling it

| Setting | Location | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `self_evolve` | Agent Settings → General tab → Self-Evolution toggle | `false` |

Only shown for predefined agents. The setting is stored as `self_evolve` in `agents.other_config`.

### What the agent can and cannot change

When `self_evolve=true`, GoClaw injects this guidance into the system prompt (~95 tokens per request):

```
## Self-Evolution

You may update SOUL.md to refine communication style (tone, voice, vocabulary, response style).
You may update CAPABILITIES.md to refine domain expertise, technical skills, and specialized knowledge.
MUST NOT change: name, identity, contact info, core purpose, IDENTITY.md, or AGENTS.md.
Make changes incrementally based on clear user feedback patterns.
```

> Source: `buildSelfEvolveSection()` in `internal/agent/systemprompt.go`.

### Security

| Layer | What it enforces |
|---|---|
| System prompt guidance | CAN/MUST NOT rules limit scope |
| Context file interceptor | Validates that only SOUL.md or CAPABILITIES.md is written |
| File locking | IDENTITY.md and AGENTS.md are always read-only |

---

## Skill Learning Loop

### What it does

When `skill_evolve` is enabled, GoClaw encourages agents to capture complex multi-step processes as reusable skills. The loop has three touch points:

1. **System prompt guidance** — injected at the start of every request with SHOULD/SHOULD NOT criteria
2. **Budget nudges** — ephemeral reminders injected mid-loop at 70% and 90% of the iteration budget
3. **Postscript suggestion** — appended to the agent's final response when enough tool calls happened; requires explicit user consent

No skill is ever created without the user replying "save as skill". Replying "skip" does nothing.

### Enabling it

| Setting | Location | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `skill_evolve` | Agent Settings → Config tab → Skill Learning toggle | `false` |
| `skill_nudge_interval` | Config tab → interval input | `15` |

`skill_nudge_interval` is the minimum number of tool calls in a run before the postscript fires. Set to `0` to disable postscripts entirely while keeping budget nudges.

Open agents always get `skill_evolve=false` regardless of the database setting — enforcement happens at the resolver level.

### How the loop flows

```
Admin enables skill_evolve
        ↓
System prompt includes Skill Creation guidance (every request)
        ↓
Agent processes request (think → act → observe)
        ↓
  ≥70% iteration budget? → ephemeral nudge (soft suggestion)
  ≥90% iteration budget? → ephemeral nudge (moderate urgency)
        ↓
Agent completes task
        ↓
  totalToolCalls ≥ skill_nudge_interval?
    No  → Normal response
    Yes → Postscript appended: "Save as skill? or skip?"
              ↓
        User replies "skip"        → No action
        User replies "save as skill" → Agent calls skill_manage(create)
                                          ↓
                                      Skill created + auto-granted
                                          ↓
                                      Available on next turn
```

### System prompt guidance

When `skill_evolve=true` and the `skill_manage` tool is registered, GoClaw injects this block (~135 tokens per request):

```
### Skill Creation (recommended after complex tasks)

After completing a complex task (5+ tool calls), consider:
"Would this process be useful again in the future?"

SHOULD create skill when:
- Process is repeatable with different inputs
- Multiple steps that are easy to forget
- Domain-specific workflow others could benefit from

SHOULD NOT create skill when:
- One-time task specific to this user/context
- Debugging or troubleshooting (too context-dependent)
- Simple tasks (< 5 tool calls)
- User explicitly said "skip" or declined

Creating: skill_manage(action="create", content="---\nname: ...\n...")
Improving: skill_manage(action="patch", slug="...", find="...", replace="...")
Removing: skill_manage(action="delete", slug="...")

Constraints:
- You can only manage skills you created (not system or other users' skills)
- Quality over quantity — one excellent skill beats five mediocre ones
- Ask user before creating if unsure
```

### Budget nudges

These are ephemeral user messages injected into the agent loop. They are **not** persisted to session history and fire at most once per run each.

**At 70% of iteration budget (~31 tokens):**
```
[System] You are at 70% of your iteration budget. Consider whether any
patterns from this session would make a good skill.
```

**At 90% of iteration budget (~48 tokens):**
```
[System] You are at 90% of your iteration budget. If this session involved
reusable patterns, consider saving them as a skill before completing.
```

### Postscript suggestion

When `totalToolCalls >= skill_nudge_interval`, this text is appended to the agent's final response (~35 tokens, persisted in session):

```
---
_This task involved several steps. Want me to save the process as a
reusable skill? Reply "save as skill" or "skip"._
```

The postscript fires at most once per run. Subsequent runs reset the flag.

### Tool gating

When `skill_evolve=false`, the `skill_manage` tool is completely hidden from the LLM — filtered from tool definitions before they are sent to the provider, and excluded from tool names in system prompt construction. The agent has zero awareness of it.

---

## Skill Management

### skill_manage tool

The `skill_manage` tool is available to agents when `skill_evolve=true`. It supports three actions:

| Action | Required params | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `create` | `content` | Creates a new skill from a SKILL.md content string |
| `patch` | `slug`, `find`, `replace` | Applies a find-and-replace patch to an existing skill |
| `delete` | `slug` | Soft-deletes a skill (moved to `.trash/`) |

**Full parameter reference:**

| Parameter | Type | Required for | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `action` | string | all | `create`, `patch`, or `delete` |
| `slug` | string | patch, delete | Unique skill identifier |
| `content` | string | create | Full SKILL.md including YAML frontmatter |
| `find` | string | patch | Exact text to find in current SKILL.md |
| `replace` | string | patch | Replacement text |
| `files` | object | optional (create, patch) | Companion text files keyed by relative path (e.g. `references/guide.md`). Each file is capped at **2 MB**; paths are validated (no `..`, absolute/Windows paths, null bytes, `SKILL.md` overwrite, dotfiles, or system artifacts) |
| `visibility` | string | optional (patch) | Metadata-only visibility change (`private` or `public`) — updates who can discover the skill without creating a new version when no `content`/`files` change |

**Example — creating a skill from conversation:**

```
skill_manage(
  action="create",
  content="---\nname: Deploy Checklist\ndescription: Steps to deploy the app safely.\n---\n\n## Steps\n1. Run tests\n2. Build image\n3. Push to registry\n4. Apply manifests\n5. Verify rollout"
)
```

**Example — patching an existing skill:**

```
skill_manage(
  action="patch",
  slug="deploy-checklist",
  find="5. Verify rollout",
  replace="5. Verify rollout\n6. Notify team in Slack"
)
```

**Example — deleting a skill:**

```
skill_manage(action="delete", slug="deploy-checklist")
```

**Example — creating a skill with a companion reference file:**

```
skill_manage(
  action="create",
  content="---\nname: Deploy Checklist\ndescription: Steps to deploy the app safely.\n---\n\n## Steps\nSee {baseDir}/references/runbook.md",
  files={"references/runbook.md": "# Runbook\n1. Run tests\n2. Build image\n3. Push to registry"}
)
```

### publish_skill tool

`publish_skill` is an alternative path that registers an entire local directory as a skill. It is always available as a built-in tool toggle (not gated by `skill_evolve`).

```
publish_skill(path="./skills/my-skill")
```

The directory must contain a `SKILL.md` with a `name` in frontmatter. The skill starts with `private` visibility and is auto-granted to the calling agent. Use the Dashboard or API to grant it to other agents.

**Comparison:**

| | `skill_manage` | `publish_skill` |
|---|---|---|
| Input | Content string | Directory path |
| Files | SKILL.md plus direct text companion files (`files=...`); patch copies existing companions forward | Entire directory (scripts, assets, etc.) |
| Gated by | `skill_evolve` config | Built-in tool toggle (always available) |
| Guidance | Injected via skill_evolve prompt | Uses `skill-creator` core skill |
| Auto-grant | Yes | Yes |

---

## Security

Every skill mutation passes through four layers before anything is written to disk.

### Layer 1 — Content Guard

Line-by-line regex scan of the SKILL.md content. Hard-reject on any match. 25 rules across 6 categories:

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Destructive shell | `rm -rf /`, fork bomb, `dd of=/dev/`, `mkfs`, `shred` |
| Code injection | `base64 -d \| sh`, `eval $(...)`, `curl \| bash`, `python -c exec()` |
| Credential exfil | `/etc/passwd`, `.ssh/id_rsa`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `GOCLAW_DB_URL` |
| Path traversal | `../../../` deep traversal |
| SQL injection | `DROP TABLE`, `TRUNCATE TABLE`, `DROP DATABASE` |
| Privilege escalation | `sudo`, world-writable `chmod`, `chown root` |

This is a defense-in-depth layer — not exhaustive. GoClaw's `exec` tool has its own runtime deny-list for shell commands.

### Layer 2 — Ownership Enforcement

Three-layer ownership check across all mutation paths:

| Layer | Check |
|---|---|
| `skill_manage` tool | `GetSkillOwnerIDBySlug(slug)` before patch/delete |
| HTTP API | `GetSkillOwnerID(uuid)` + admin role bypass |
| WebSocket gateway | `skillOwnerGetter` interface + admin role bypass |

Agents can only modify skills they created. Admins can bypass ownership checks. System skills (`is_system=true`) cannot be modified through any path.

### Layer 3 — System Skill Guard

System skills are always read-only. Any attempt to patch or delete a skill with `is_system=true` is rejected before reaching the filesystem.

### Layer 4 — Filesystem Safety

| Protection | Detail |
|---|---|
| Symlink detection | `filepath.WalkDir` checks for symlinks — rejects any |
| Path traversal | Rejects paths containing `..` segments |
| SKILL.md size limit | 100 KB max |
| Companion files size limit | 20 MB max total (scripts, assets) |
| Soft-delete | Files moved to `.trash/`, never hard-deleted |

---

## Versioning and Storage

Each create or patch produces a new immutable version directory. GoClaw always serves the highest-numbered version.

```
skills-store/
├── deploy-checklist/
│   ├── 1/
│   │   └── SKILL.md
│   └── 2/              ← patch created this version
│       └── SKILL.md
├── .trash/
│   └── old-skill.1710000000   ← soft-deleted
```

Concurrent version creation for the same skill is serialized via `pg_advisory_xact_lock` keyed on FNV-64a hash of the slug. Version numbers are computed inside the transaction using `COALESCE(MAX(version), 0) + 1`.

---

## Token Cost

| Component | When active | Approx tokens | Persisted? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Self-evolve section | `self_evolve=true` | ~95 | Every request |
| Skill creation guidance | `skill_evolve=true` | ~135 | Every request |
| `skill_manage` tool definition | `skill_evolve=true` | ~290 | Every request |
| Budget nudge 70% | iter ≥ 70% of max | ~31 | No (ephemeral) |
| Budget nudge 90% | iter ≥ 90% of max | ~48 | No (ephemeral) |
| Postscript | toolCalls ≥ interval | ~35 | Yes |

Maximum overhead per run with both features enabled: ~305 tokens for skill learning (~1.5% of a 128K context). When both are disabled (the default), zero token overhead.

## v3: Evolution Metrics and Suggestion Engine

v3 adds automated, metrics-driven evolution for predefined agents. This operates separately from the manual skill learning loop above.

### How It Works

```
Metrics collected during agent runs (7-day rolling window)
    ↓
SuggestionEngine.Analyze() — runs daily via cron
    ├─ LowRetrievalUsageRule  (avg recall < threshold)
    ├─ ToolFailureRule         (single tool failure rate > 20%)
    └─ RepeatedToolRule        (tool called 5+ consecutive times)
    ↓
Suggestion created with status "pending"
    ↓
Admin reviews → approve / reject / rollback
```

### Metric Types

| Type | What is tracked | Examples |
|------|----------------|---------|
| `tool` | Per-tool performance | invocation_count, success_rate, failure_count, avg_duration_ms |
| `retrieval` | Knowledge retrieval quality | recall_rate, precision, relevance_score |
| `feedback` | User satisfaction signals | rating, sentiment, effectiveness_score |

Metrics aggregate over 7-day rolling windows. At least 100 data points are required before a suggestion can be auto-applied (configurable via `min_data_points` guardrail).

### Suggestion Types

| Type | Trigger | Recommendation |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `low_retrieval_usage` | Avg recall below threshold for 7 days | Lower `retrieval_threshold` by ≤ 0.1 |
| `tool_failure` | Single tool failure rate > 20% | Review tool config or add fallback |
| `repeated_tool` | Same tool called 5+ consecutive times | Extract workflow as a skill |

Only one pending suggestion of each type per agent exists at a time (duplicate prevention).

### Auto-Adapt Guardrails

Suggestions can be auto-applied when approved. Guardrails prevent runaway parameter changes:

| Guardrail | Default | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `max_delta_per_cycle` | 0.1 | Max parameter change per apply cycle |
| `min_data_points` | 100 | Minimum metrics required before applying |
| `rollback_on_drop_pct` | 20.0 | Auto-rollback if quality drops >20% after apply |
| `locked_params` | `[]` | Parameters that cannot be auto-changed |

Baseline parameter values are stored in the suggestion's `parameters._baseline` field for rollback.

### Evolution Cron

Analysis runs on a configurable schedule (default: daily at 02:00). Set via `evolution_cron_schedule` in agent config:

```json
{
  "evolution_enabled": true,
  "evolution_cron_schedule": "every day at 02:00",
  "evolution_guardrails": {
    "max_delta_per_cycle": 0.1,
    "min_data_points": 100,
    "rollback_on_drop_pct": 20.0,
    "locked_params": []
  }
}
```

Set `evolution_enabled: false` to disable all metrics collection for an agent.

### HTTP API

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/v1/agents/{id}/evolution/metrics` | Query/aggregate metrics |
| `GET` | `/v1/agents/{id}/evolution/suggestions` | List suggestions |
| `PATCH` | `/v1/agents/{id}/evolution/suggestions/{sid}` | Approve / reject / rollback |

WebSocket equivalents: `agent.evolution.metrics`, `agent.evolution.suggestions`, `agent.evolution.apply`, `agent.evolution.rollback`.

---

## Skill Self-Evolution (per-skill metrics)

This is a **separate subsystem** from the agent-level "v3 Evolution Metrics" above. Where agent-level evolution tunes an *agent's* parameters, skill self-evolution tracks how each **existing skill** performs over time and proposes improvements to that skill. It is also distinct from the `skill_evolve` learning loop, which teaches an agent *when* to create or patch reusable skills.

### Runtime recording

Usage is recorded automatically as agents use skills — there is **no public usage endpoint**:

- `use_skill` tool calls record tenant-scoped usage with status `succeeded` or `failed`, plus duration, session key, run/trace ID, agent ID, and user scope.
- Slash-command activation (`/<slug>` or `/use <skill>`) records a `started` event when it resolves to a skill.
- Usage writes are **internal only**. v1 intentionally has no public `POST /v1/skills/{id}/usage` endpoint, so clients cannot forge success rates.

### Persistent tables

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `skill_evolution_settings` | Per-tenant, per-skill `enabled` flag and `mode` |
| `skill_usage_metrics` | Runtime usage events and status counts |
| `skill_improvement_suggestions` | Skill-scoped suggestions with evidence and draft patches |
| `skill_versions` | Immutable applied-version records linked to changed files and the originating suggestion |

### Modes and statuses

| Field | Values | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Settings `mode` | `suggest_only` (default), `auto_analyze` | No automatic *patching* happens in v1 — `auto_analyze` only generates suggestions automatically |
| Usage `status` | `started`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `abandoned` | Recorded per skill invocation |
| Suggestion `status` | `pending`, `approved`, `rejected`, `applied` | Lifecycle of an improvement suggestion |

### Applying a suggestion

Suggestions are reviewed and applied by admins. Applying a suggestion to a **custom** skill:

1. Copies the current skill directory forward to the next version.
2. Validates the target path (same rules as `skill_manage` companion files).
3. Runs the SKILL.md content guard scanner when SKILL.md changes.
4. Updates the active skill and records a new `skill_versions` row.
5. Writes an activity log entry.

**System/bundled skill mutation is refused** — the apply path returns `403` for any skill with `is_system = true`, before touching the filesystem.

### Admin-gated surfaces

Viewer surfaces are sanitized. Failure evidence, draft patches, actor IDs, and activity details require **admin** visibility — non-admins see only aggregate, non-sensitive data.

### HTTP API

| Method | Path | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/v1/skills/{id}/evolution` | Read self-evolution settings |
| `PATCH` | `/v1/skills/{id}/evolution` | Set `enabled` / `mode` (tenant admin) |
| `GET` | `/v1/skills/{id}/metrics` | Usage metrics (total / started / succeeded / failed / abandoned / success rate) |
| `GET` | `/v1/skills/{id}/activity` | Recent self-evolution activity (admin only) |
| `GET` | `/v1/skills/{id}/evolution/suggestions` | List suggestions for the skill |
| `POST` | `/v1/skills/{id}/evolution/suggestions/{sid}/approve` | Approve a suggestion (tenant admin) |
| `POST` | `/v1/skills/{id}/evolution/suggestions/{sid}/reject` | Reject a suggestion (tenant admin) |
| `POST` | `/v1/skills/{id}/evolution/suggestions/{sid}/apply` | Apply an approved suggestion (tenant admin) |

The matching CLI commands are `goclaw skills evolve`, `goclaw skills metrics`, `goclaw skills suggestions`, and `goclaw skills activity`. The Dashboard surfaces all of this in the skill detail's **Evolution** tab.

---

## Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Self-Evolution toggle not visible | Agent is not predefined type | Self-evolution is only for predefined agents |
| Skill not saved after postscript | User did not reply "save as skill" | Postscript requires explicit consent — reply with exact phrase |
| `skill_manage` not available to agent | `skill_evolve=false` or agent is open type | Enable `skill_evolve` in Config tab; verify agent is predefined |
| Patch fails with "not owner" | Agent trying to patch another agent's skill | Each agent can only modify skills it created |
| Patch fails with "system skill" | Attempting to modify a built-in system skill | System skills are always read-only |
| Skill content rejected | Content matched a security rule in guard.go | Remove the flagged pattern; see Layer 1 categories above |
| Companion file rejected by `skill_manage` | Path uses `..`, an absolute/Windows path, a dotfile, or a system artifact; or the file exceeds 2 MB | Use a clean relative path under the skill root and keep each text file under 2 MB |
| Cannot apply a skill suggestion | Target is a system/bundled skill, or the suggestion is not yet `approved` | System skills are read-only; approve the suggestion first, then apply |
| Skill metrics show no data | No `use_skill`/slash-command activations recorded yet, or self-evolution disabled | Usage is recorded internally as agents use the skill; enable self-evolution in the skill's Evolution tab |
