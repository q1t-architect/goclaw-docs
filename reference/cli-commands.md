# CLI Commands

> Complete reference for every `goclaw` command, subcommand, and flag.

## Overview

The `goclaw` binary is a single executable that starts the gateway and provides management subcommands. Global flags apply to all commands.

```bash
goclaw [global flags] <command> [subcommand] [flags] [args]
```

**Global flags**

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--config <path>` | `config.json` | Config file path. Also read from `$GOCLAW_CONFIG` |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | false | Enable debug logging |

---

## Gateway (default)

Running `goclaw` with no subcommand starts the gateway.

```bash
./goclaw
source .env.local && ./goclaw          # with secrets loaded
GOCLAW_CONFIG=/etc/goclaw.json ./goclaw
```

On first run (no config file), the setup wizard launches automatically.

---

## `version`

Print version and protocol number.

```bash
goclaw version
# goclaw v1.2.0 (protocol 3)
```

---

## `onboard`

Interactive setup wizard — configure provider, model, gateway port, channels, features, and database.

```bash
goclaw onboard
```

Steps:
1. AI provider + API key (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, DeepSeek, Gemini, Mistral, xAI, MiniMax, Cohere, Perplexity, Claude CLI, Custom)
2. Gateway port (default: 18790)
3. Channels (Telegram, Zalo OA, Feishu/Lark)
4. Features (memory, browser automation)
5. TTS provider
6. PostgreSQL DSN

Saves `config.json` (no secrets) and `.env.local` (secrets only).

**Environment-based auto-onboard** — if the required env vars are set, the wizard is skipped and setup runs non-interactively (useful for Docker/CI).

---

## `agent`

Manage agents — add, list, delete, and chat.

### `agent list`

List all configured agents.

```bash
goclaw agent list
goclaw agent list --json
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--json` | Output as JSON |

### `agent add`

Interactive wizard to add a new agent.

```bash
goclaw agent add
```

Prompts: agent name, display name, provider (or inherit), model (or inherit), workspace directory. Saves to `config.json`. Restart gateway to activate.

### `agent delete`

Delete an agent from config.

```bash
goclaw agent delete <agent-id>
goclaw agent delete researcher --force
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--force` | Skip confirmation prompt |

Also removes bindings referencing the deleted agent.

### `agent chat`

Send a one-shot message to an agent via the running gateway.

```bash
goclaw agent chat "What files are in the workspace?"
goclaw agent chat --agent researcher "Summarize today's news"
goclaw agent chat --session my-session "Continue where we left off"
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--agent <id>` | `default` | Target agent ID |
| `--session <key>` | auto | Session key to resume |
| `--json` | false | Output response as JSON |

---

## `migrate`

Database migration management. All subcommands require `GOCLAW_POSTGRES_DSN`.

```bash
goclaw migrate [--migrations-dir <path>] <subcommand>
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--migrations-dir <path>` | Path to migrations directory (default: `./migrations`) |

### `migrate up`

Apply all pending migrations.

```bash
goclaw migrate up
```

After SQL migrations, runs pending Go-based data hooks.

### `migrate down`

Roll back migrations.

```bash
goclaw migrate down           # roll back 1 step
goclaw migrate down -n 3      # roll back 3 steps
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-n`, `--steps <n>` | 1 | Number of steps to roll back |

### `migrate version`

Show current migration version.

```bash
goclaw migrate version
# version: 10, dirty: false
```

### `migrate force <version>`

Force-set the migration version without applying SQL (use after manual fixes).

```bash
goclaw migrate force 9
```

### `migrate goto <version>`

Migrate to a specific version (up or down).

```bash
goclaw migrate goto 5
```

### `migrate drop`

**DANGEROUS.** Drop all tables.

```bash
goclaw migrate drop
```

---

## `upgrade`

Upgrade database schema and run data migrations. Idempotent — safe to run multiple times.

```bash
goclaw upgrade
goclaw upgrade --dry-run    # preview without applying
goclaw upgrade --status     # show current upgrade status
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--dry-run` | Show what would be done without applying |
| `--status` | Show current schema version and pending hooks |

Gateway startup also checks schema compatibility. Set `GOCLAW_AUTO_UPGRADE=true` to auto-upgrade on startup.
